## CONTEXT - CORRUPTION, CRIME, ETC

- Peacock & Beltrán (2003) and Beltran (2016):

Deterioration of human rights situation in Guatemala after the end of the war. Strong links to the civil war. Dynamics of killings indicate selective targeting of HR activists. The leaders of the clandestine security groups operating in Guatemala are believed to be former military officers.
Linked to the FRG.
In 2015 the situation it was still no good, even though some improvements took place (creating of the CIGIC in 2007, later prosecution of Pérez Molina, who was the first former military office to be President of Guatemala since the end of military rule in the 1986.) (Beltran 2016)

- Booth et al 2010 (p.148ff):

* Murder of Bishop Gerardi in 1998 two days after publishing the Catholic Church's HR office report as one of the signs that made clear how difficult it was consolidating civilian democracy. "Death squad long connected to the presidential guard later claimed credit for the murder and began intimidating other Catholic human rights workers." (148)
* Growing social violence surrounded 1999 elections. A lot of violence linked to organized crime groups and clandestine security organizations, not just youth gangs. "The roots of post-conflict violence in Guatemala were increasingly linked back to the war. Clandestine security organizations created during the war had never been fully dismantled."

- Levenson (2013)

The increase in youth gangs also indirectly linked to the war, as they flourish in a weak state environment. Also, violence as a means to resolve problems inherited from the war.

Their presence has also been used to justify increased military involvement in civilian rule.

On their non being political: "the notion that the gangs and their violence are apolitical. I argue that this is a misleading conceptualization. While it is descriptively accurate that neither the Maras nor their violence fall within the realm of what one sociologist defines as political violence, ... the Maras have come out of a political crucible, and politicians have found political uses for them that range from no doubt paying them to disrupt rallies for rival candidates to using images of them to garner support for right wing candidates." (8)

Initially the Maras grew up to protect neighborhoods etc and out of the 1980s class solidarity.
