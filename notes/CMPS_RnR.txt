CMPS R&R (April 28, 2021)
=========================

-- Brief summary empirics (R files) --

* Show control variables in appendix
* Other parties in 1999-2015? Especially after 1999
* Include iliteracy (R2 on income)
* Check heteroskedascity & multicoll (VIF)
* Show simpler analyses without control variables (proxy variabel analyses)
* Check using turnout as dependent variable

- For the mechanisms section:
* Tables with municipalities mentioned
* Evidence from Latinobarometro



------------------------------------------------
-- EDITOR:

Issues best summed up by R2:
  1) slippage between theory and empirics
  2) lack of qualitative (or quant) evidence to nail down the mechanisms

------------------------
-- R1:

> Biggest issue: the use of a proxy.

> Two competing theories exists: a) more violence in more accessible areas (but I already prove that). However, potential inflation of SEs!

b) the road variables actually proxy for "insularity from national-level politics". Can I account for this alternative explanation? (!!!!) Is it actually an alternative explanation?

> Better connection between the proxy and the theory? Similar to R2's comments.

Solution: some more qualitative evidence.

> Role of propaganda and co-optation. CHECK paragraph on preference falsification referencing Matanock & Garcia Sanchez 2018 and Young 2019.

> "Largest obstacle to recommending publicacion is accounting for the alternative explanation of the proxy measures capturing insularity and not the opposition's political mobilization."

> Minor points:
- Show control variables in the Appendix!
- Specify model used in predicted probability plots. Also which election year and which department were chosen?
- Check Muller-Crepon et al 2021 on "roads to rule, roads to rebel?"



------------------------
-- R2:

> Theory not really tested with empirics. No measurement of state propaganda. Could it just be that leftist communities interpret events differently? (Chcek Lyall, Blair, and Imai 2013)
* Solution: testing the propaganda mechanism (surveys?) or change the theory: a broader frame.
Check: Lyall et al 2013, Silverman 2019, expand into longer-run dynamics.
"Ideologically driven resistance to propaganda could be one potentia mech, but not the only one -- and it shouldn't be such a central part of the story since it can't be tested"

> Need to evidence on the mechanisms! Qualitative evidence, ideally!
* Solution: "Identifying mechanisms" section.
Try to prove:
Priests and activists spread through the road network?
Did they turn people into leftists?
Evidence of postwar activity to commemorate the violence?
Survey evidence? Check LAPOP, Latinobaro etc

> Others:
* Placebo test using leftist vote in the 1940s-1950s?
* Other parties in 1999-2015? Especially after 1999.
* Explain time decay, at least engage with it. Conclusion?

------------------------
-- R3:

> Corruption? Re state fragility etc. Check perceptions in LAPOP? Or mention in a footnote?

> Organized crime? Police curruption, etc? Maybe mention in a footnote?

"Central American maras: from youth street gangs to transnational protection rackets" (2010), "Criminal Violence and Democratization in Central America: The Survival of the Violent State" (LAPS, 2011).
Perhaps to argue about the criminal continuity of the war etc? Related to R Bateson? in the LAPS one: 'This article argues that public security reforms carried out during the political transitions shaped the ability of the new regimes to control the violence produced by their own institutions and collaborators.'
