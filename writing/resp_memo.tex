\section*{Reviewer 4}

First, I would like to thank the reviewer for all the comments. They were very thoughtful and useful in improving the manuscript, particularly in terms of making the argument and the contribution more clear. I respond to each one below.

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 1:}
\begin{displayquote}
It is unclear whether the author is focusing on violence or propaganda-while these two things are closely related they are also very different. More clarity on this is needed throughout.
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}


\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 2:}
\begin{displayquote}
Author states previous work treats relationship between violence and civilian political preferences as a black box - can they expand? What information is missing from previous research?
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}

This comment hints at the idea that the effect of violence is usually theoretized to take place homogenously, without discussion about potential third-factors that influence its present

Added ``Previous research has treated the process that leads from violent events to a change in political preferences as a black box. In other words, we know little about potential heterogenous effects or the factors that explain why legacies of violence might be present in some cases but not in others.''


\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 3:}
\begin{displayquote}
"Individuals are assumed to objectively interpret violent events, and no attention is paid to those external factors that might influence this interpretation, such as propaganda or cooptation efforts by the perpetrator". -- this sentence is key-would put it in the introduction to clarify contribution from the beginning.
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}


\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 4:}
\begin{displayquote}
"I focus on the case of Guatemala, which is a good example of the use of denying and cooptation strategies". - does this mean it's unique? How does it compare to other cases?
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}

Justify Guate case

Have rephrased in the introduction to:
``I focus on the case of Guatemala, where there was an active debate about the responsibility of wartime events and where state authorities actively engaged in cooptation strategies as part of the counterinsurgency campaign.
However, this example is far from unique, as in many other postwar contexts there is usually a controversy on blame attribution, where political actors often take an active role.''

\textbf{{\color{red}{Add something in conclusion as well?}}}

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 5:}
\begin{displayquote}
How does the article relate to research on misinformation? Are there parallels to be drawn from the use of misinformation in political campaigns/where it is most successful?
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}


\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 6:}
\begin{displayquote}
I'm unclear on how a scorched earth campaign could gain support from the civilian population
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}

Agree with the reviewer that this is a counterintruitive finding, but highlighting this heterogenous effects of violence is precisely the goal of the manuscript.

Paragraph 2 in page 2 summarizes how this could have happened, mainly through fear:

``In the aftermath of the victimization campaign that took place in the early 1980s, the Guatemalan state tried to deny war events, set up a discourse that justified military actions as a necessary step to bring peace to the country, and forcefully recruited civilians into paramilitary units of local defense.
In a country where many areas had been isolated from national politics and where political illiteracy was rampant, this strategy was to a large extent successful.''

Similarly, in page 7:

``The victimization campaign of the early 1980s disrupted local communities. It pitted neighbors against neighbors and installed a climate of fear and distrust that would leave long-term consequences \citep{Burrell:2013aa}.
The government successfully destroyed Maya social organizations and gained forced cooperation from local people. (...)

The PAC system was designed to ensure compliance within the countryside.
It forced local civilians to `defend' themselves from the guerrilla and, in many cases, successfully convinced them that they were on the good side and that violence and insecurity was the rebels' fault.''

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 7:}
\begin{displayquote}
With the PAC system-couldn't civilians just go through the motions without actually believing rebels were the enemy? What did the government do to actually convince them?
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}



\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 8:}
\begin{displayquote}
I still don't understand how the state managed to avoid being blamed for acts of wartime victimization. Need more details in the theory and evidence section on how propaganda could overcome experiences with wartime victimization.
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}

As with comment 6 above, this counterintuitive finding is actually at the core of the argument. Blah blah. Basically the theoretical argument is the answer: not only that some communities backfired (which is actually what we would expect according to previous research), but that the opposite was true in some other communities.

Also, have added some clarifications at the end of the page 8: refering to the fear and cooptation mechanisms.

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 9:}
\begin{displayquote}
The author needs to differentiate between communities' ability to resist co-optation strategies, and just being ideologically opposed to the government. Isn't it more plausible that these communities were simply ideologically opposed to the government? I understand that these two mechanisms could operate in conjunction with one another but I remain unconvinced that the author's plays a significant role.
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}



\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 10:}
\begin{displayquote}
Why is there no data on vote share for the FRG in 2011? Why does vote share drop so significantly for both parties over the years?
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}

explain that the FRG did not run in 2011 blah blah (mentioned in footnote 5).
the decline of vote over the years is indeed a more serious question, raised by previous reviewers.

I could not engage in a longer discussion on this in the main text because of space constrains.

From previous revision memo:

``My strategy to deal with this was to include in Appendix F results of the main models but including more parties, both leftist and rightist, in the calculation of the dependent variable, together with the URNG and FRG. The goal is to try to capture votes that, even if preference-wise are determined by leftist or rightist preferences as a result of wartime dynamics, go to different but related parties. In particular, I include the Partido Patriota (PP) and the Frente de Convergencia Nacional (FCN) together with the FRG, and the Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza (UNE) together with the URNG. Both PP and FCN are major parties (most voted parties in some elections, their leaders are or have been Presidents of Guatemala) that have been allegedly linked to a similar discourse as the FRG’s and to military officers accused of human rights violations during the war. The UNE is also a major left-wing party that has headed by former PresidentofGuatemalaA ́lvaroColom,whohadbeenamemberofURNGbefore.Inany case, one of the reasons why the effect disappears might be because after 2007 there was barely any discourse among left-wing parties that directly pointed to the revolutionary spirit of the guerrillas \citep{Ibarra:2008to}.''

\noindent\textbf{Comment 11:}
\begin{displayquote}
The author blends together a lot of concepts in their explanation of what determines communities' reaction to propaganda-pre-war political mobilization, literacy, collective story telling, ideological capital-it becomes confusing as to which one is the most important. If the author thinks they are all equally important, that should be laid out from the beginning and in the theory section.
\end{displayquote}

\noindent\textbf{Response:}

\vspace{15pt}
\noindent\textbf{Comment 12:}
\begin{displayquote}
The author should explain why they include the controls that they do-as of right now there is no explanation, just a list of variables.
\end{displayquote}

The paper would benefit from more discussion of the quantitative results-what do they actually mean, what can we conclude from them?

The qualititave section seems ad hoc-what strategy did the author use to find these sources? What sources were reviewed?
