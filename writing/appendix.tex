\section{Territorial changes in municipalities}\label{app:muni}

A `minimum denomination' of municipalities was built, by joining together those municipalities where changes took place, which consisted mainly of splits.
Thus, if a new municipality was formed out of a bigger one, the two are merged again in the dataset, so as to ensure compatibility between data sources across time.
In particular, the dataset contains observations that range from 1973 to 2015, during which time there has been 15 territorial changes at the local level.
Although one variable goes further back in time, namely rebel activity before 1978, only two territorial changes took place before that date: the formation of Melchor de Mencos (1962) and Poptún (1966).%, both in the department of Petén.
Given that no rebel activity was recorded in the whole territory of Petén before 1971, these two changes were not implemented.
Table \ref{tab:muni} below shows the municipalities that were formed, along with the data and the parent municipality they are merged to in the dataset.

\section{Accessibility and violence against civilians}\label{app:lm_violence}

This section of the appendix tests the assumption that road accessibility was not an important factor explaining wartime violence by either the state or the rebels.
As in the main text, the violence dependent variables are log-transformed and weighted by population, i.e. logged number of killings for every 1000 inhabitants.

Table \ref{tab:lm_govt_vi} shows the results of linear models explaining wartime violence by the state, while Table \ref{tab:lm_govt_vi_hv} repeats these analyses for a subsample of the most affected departments.
In both cases, models with and without control variables, and with and without department fixed effeccts are included.

State violence does not have any relevant relationship with the two proxy variables used as interactions.
If anything, it has a positive relationship with the share of non-paved roads in Model 1 in Table \ref{tab:lm_govt_vi}, but the effect disappears once either control variables or department fixed effects are included.
Regarding the other variables, state violence is mainly explained by the share of indigenous population in each municipality and by its size.
When limiting the sample to the most affected departments and including fixed effects, the share of indigenous population stops being significant.

Table \ref{tab:lm_rebels_vi} shows the results for models equivalent to the previous ones but using rebel violence as the dependent variable, while Table \ref{tab:lm_rebels_vi_hv} shows equivalent models but for municipalities in the most affected departments.
Although patterns of rebel violence should not be as relevant to the argument advanced here, it is important to check whether any of the two accessibility proxies is related to local wartime activity.
Again, none of the accessibility proxies shows any relationship to rebel violence.
Rebel violence is also poorly explained by the rest of the variables.
Perhaps because of the relatively low incidence of violence by the rebels, no robust relationship is found.

The results show that the two accessibility variables used as proxies for the level of exposure to prewar mobilization are not related to the intensity of the conflict in each municipality.

\section{Full tables (main text)}\label{app:results_tablong}

\section{Results using only CEH data for violence variables}\label{app:results_ceh}

Tables \ref{tab:lm_roads_ceh} and \ref{tab:lm_panam_ceh} replicate the main results using only CEH data to measure wartime violence.

\section{Results aggregating several parties}\label{app:results_full}

Table \ref{tab:lm_fulldcha} replicates the main results but including as the dependent variable the combined share of several related right-wing parties: FRG (as in main results), \textit{Partido Patriota} (PP), and \textit{Frente de Convergencia Nacional} (FCN).
Table \ref{tab:lm_fullizq} shows results for similar models but using a combined share of related left-wing parties: URNG (as in main results) and \textit{Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza} (UNE).

Figure \ref{fig:pp_fulldcha_roads} and figure \ref{fig:pp_fulldcha_panam} shows the predicted share of right-wing support (FRG + PP + FCN) depending on the number of non-paved roads and the distance to the Pan-American Highway, respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:pp_fullizq_roads} and figure \ref{fig:pp_fullizq_panam} do the same but with the predicted left-wing or revolutionary support (URNG + UNE).

Results are similar to the ones in the main text, suggesting that the effect of wartime violence on political preferences corresponds to an ideological shift and does not suffer from partisan bias.
