\section{Territorial changes in municipalities}\label{app:muni}

A `minimum denomination' of municipalities was developed by joining together those municipalities where changes took place, which consisted mainly of splits.
Thus, if a new municipality was creating by splitting off a bigger one, the two are merged again in the dataset, so as to ensure compatibility between data sources across time.
In particular, the dataset contains observations that range from 1973 to 2015, during which there were 15 territorial changes at the local level.
Although one variable goes further back in time (namely rebel activity before 1978) only two territorial changes took place before that date: the formation of Melchor de Mencos in 1962 and Poptún in 1966.%, both in the department of Petén.
Given that no rebel activity was recorded in the whole territory of Petén before 1971, these two changes were not implemented.
Table \ref{tab:muni} below lists new municipalities that formed since 1973, along with the parent municipality they are merged to in the dataset.

\section{Accessibility and violence against civilians}\label{app:lm_violence}

This section tests the assumption that road accessibility was not a driver of wartime violence by either the state or the rebels.
As in the main text, the dependent variables are log-transformed and weighted by population, i.e. logged number of killings for every 1000 inhabitants.

Table \ref{tab:lm_govt_vi} shows the results of linear models explaining wartime violence by the state, while table \ref{tab:lm_govt_vi_hv} repeats these analyses for a subsample of the most affected departments.
In both cases, models with and without control variables, and with and without department fixed effects are included.

State violence does not have any relevant relationship with the two proxy variables used as interactions.
If anything, it has a positive relationship with the share of non-paved roads in Model 1 in table \ref{tab:lm_govt_vi}, but the effect disappears once either control variables or department fixed effects are included (or both).
Regarding the other variables, state violence is mainly explained by the share of indigenous population in each municipality and by its size.
However, when limiting the sample to the most affected departments and including fixed effects, the share of indigenous population stops being significant, suggesting regionally concentrated dynamics.

Table \ref{tab:lm_rebels_vi} shows the results for models equivalent to the previous ones but using rebel violence as the dependent variable, while table \ref{tab:lm_rebels_vi_hv} shows the same models but for municipalities in the most affected departments.
Although patterns of rebel violence should not be as relevant to the theoretical argument, it is important to check whether any of the two accessibility proxies is related to local wartime activity.
Again, none of the two proxies shows any relationship to rebel violence.
Rebel violence is also poorly explained by the rest of the variables, perhaps because of the relatively low incidence of violence by the rebels.

The results show that the two accessibility variables used as proxies for the level of exposure to prewar mobilization are not related to the intensity of the conflict in each municipality.

\section{Full tables (main text)}\label{app:results_tablong}

\section{Results using only CEH data for violence variables}\label{app:results_ceh}

Tables \ref{tab:lm_roads_ceh} and \ref{tab:lm_panam_ceh} replicate the main results using only CEH data to measure wartime state violence.

\section{Results aggregating several parties}\label{app:results_full}

Table \ref{tab:lm_fulldcha} replicates the main results but including as the dependent variable the combined share of several related right-wing parties: FRG (as in main results), \textit{Partido Patriota} (PP), and \textit{Frente de Convergencia Nacional} (FCN).
Table \ref{tab:lm_fullizq} shows results for similar models but using a combined share of related left-wing parties: URNG (as in main results) and \textit{Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza} (UNE).

Figure \ref{fig:pp_fulldcha_roads} and figure \ref{fig:pp_fulldcha_panam} shows the predicted share of right-wing support (FRG + PP + FCN) depending on the number of non-paved roads and the distance to the Pan-American Highway, respectively.
Figure \ref{fig:pp_fullizq_roads} and figure \ref{fig:pp_fullizq_panam} do the same but with the predicted left-wing or revolutionary support (URNG + UNE).

Results are similar to the ones in the main text, suggesting that the effect of wartime violence on political preferences corresponds to an ideological shift and is not mainly limited to the main parties analyzed (URNG and FRG).

\section{Results of cross-sectional models by election}\label{app:results_year}

Table \ref{tab:lm_URNG_base_year} shows results for the base models (without interactions) on URNG vote using a cross-section of each election.
Tables \ref{tab:lm_URNG_roads_year} and \ref{tab:lm_URNG_panam_year} include the interaction with the share of non-paved roads and distance to the Pan-American Highway, respectively.
Table \ref{tab:lm_FRG_base_year} shows these same base models for the FRG vote, while tables \ref{tab:lm_FRG_roads_year} and \ref{tab:lm_FRG_panam_year} include the interaction with the share of non-paved roads and distance to the Highway, respectively.
All these cross-sectional models include as well turnout as a control variable (except in 2007, for which no data is available).

Results can be clearly seen in the predicted shares plots.
Figure \ref{fig:pp_URNG_roads_yrs} shows the predicted share of URNG votes in each election depending on state violence and the share of non-paved roads.
Figure \ref{fig:pp_URNG_panam_yrs} uses distance to the Pan-American Highway as the interaction variable.
Figure \ref{fig:pp_FRG_roads_yrs} and figure \ref{fig:pp_FRG_panam_yrs} repeat these same graphs, respectively, but using FRG vote share as the predicted value.
